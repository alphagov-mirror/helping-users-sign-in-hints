						  <p>The first first thing you will do is create a username and password. This is so you can reuse your digital identity wherever you see the GOV.UK Verify logo.</p>

						  <p>You need to provide some personal details, including identity documents if you have them, so they can be double checked against records held by mobile phone providers, credit agencies, HM Passport Office or DVLA for example.</p>
