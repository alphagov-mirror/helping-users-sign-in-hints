  <h2 class="heading-medium">1. Select the identity account you want to use</h2>

  <p>Each identity account has different requirements, so we’ll now ask you some questions to filter out the accounts that won’t work for you. </p>

  <p>When you select the account you want to use, we’ll send you to their website.</p>



  <h2 class="heading-medium">2. Confirm your details so they can verify your identity</h2>

  <p>The first first thing you will have to do is create a username and password. This is so you can reuse your identity account wherever you see the GOV.UK Verify logo.</p>

  <p>You will need to provide some personal details, including identity documents if you have them, so they can double check them against records held by mobile phone providers, credit agencies, HM Passport Office or DVLA for example.</p>



  <h2 class="heading-medium">3. Continue to GOV.UK to access {{serviceNameLower}}</h2>

  <p>When you're identity account is set up, you will be sent back to GOV.UK so you can safely and securely {{serviceNameLower}}.</p>

  <p>You only need to set up one identity account, next time you just sign in with your username and password.</p>
